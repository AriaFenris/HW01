Write a text file, named `[groupname].md` with the following format per member:

```
* Name:
  * Nickname:
  * Major:
  * E-mail:
  * Class Expectations:
```

For example, if __Ken Lee__ and __Kennoth Lah__ decides to form a group named __foobar__, they should create a file named `foobar.md` containing:

```
* Name: Ken Lee
  * Nickname: Can
  * Major: 3-BS CS
  * E-mail: do.anything@gmail.com
  * Class Expectations: Bring it on!
* Name: Kennoth Lah
  * Nickname: Cannot
  * Major: 3-BS CS
  * E-mail: do.nothing@gmail.com
  * Class Expectations: To discover my own worth in this world of never-ending possibilities.
```

Don't forget to submit a pull request to me afterwards!
